MediaWiki MultiAuthPlugin
-------------------------

0. Quick usage
--------------
The 'MultiAuthPlugin/' folder should be placed under the 'wiki/extensions/' directory.

The plugin can be activated by putting the following lines at the _end_ 
of the 'wiki/LocalSettings.php'

if (!$wgCommandLineMode) {
    # extension includes
    require_once("extensions/MultiAuthPlugin/MultiAuthPlugin.php");
}

To activate the debug log capability you have to make the 'log/' directory 
writeable by the web server and create a 'log/debug.log' file - also writeable 
by the web server.




1. Introduction
---------------
At the Regional Computing Centre Erlangen (RRZE) we use the popular MediaWiki
software (http://www.mediawiki.org/) in many projects for documentation and
publication purposes.

With the development of a Single Sign On infrastructure based on SimpleSAMLphp
and Shibboleth we needed to make MediaWiki SSO capable in a flexible and easily
configurable way. We are aware that there are already extensions out there
providing simple SSO capabilities, but we wanted more.

So we started developing the MediaWiki MultiAuthPlugin with the goal to provide
a single plugin to manage all possible authentication scenarios with one
single extension -- for example local authentication via original 
MediaWiki login dialog (as fallback), SSO via Shibboleth, SSO via
SimpleSAMLphp, and so on.




2. Requirements
---------------
The MediaWiki MultiAuthPlugin was developed and	tested using MediaWiki v1.13.4
and v1.15.1. So the MultiAuthPlugin should be working flawlessly with these 
versions. 




3. Features
-----------
The MultiAuthPlugin hacks into MW's UserLoadFromSession Hook and replaces the
global $wgAuth authentication instance to take complete control of the user
authentication.

In addition the extension also installs two new special pages to replace the 
original login/logout special pages. This way the user can choose how he would
like to authenticate from the configured methods.

The plugin allows you to 
	- use local MW authentication in parallel with external authentication
	- completely forbid local authentication - if desired
	- configure an external authentication library for SSO
		Currently one of {Shibboleth, SimpleSAMLphp} is possible at a time
	- auto-create local user accounts if authenticated externally
	- auto-update changed user preferences in local user accounts if 
		authenticated externally
	- send e-mail notification about auto-created users to a configurable e-mail 
		address


If you make the log/ directory writeable the extension also provides a 
debug.log file to help you identify possible errors.
